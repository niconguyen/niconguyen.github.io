## What is R?

**Programming language:**  

* **script which works like a "full program"** (similar to an Excel macro) and like a command for a punctual action  

* **created by / for statisticians**: "working with data" is at the heart of this platform  

* **open source (free)**: though some services / supports could be invoiced, the core of the platform is fully free  
* **supported by a very large community**: the users base of R is over the ones of SPSS and SAS (but not yet Excel!); the digital analytists community of R grows quickly  

* **connectable with multiple sources of data**: several "packages" have been created to connect to platforms of digital analytics through their APIs, as well as to Google Sheets  

> Why using R (instead of Excel?) ?

In a few words:  
* **reproducibility**: possibility to write a function (or a script) for one project / client and to **reuse** it for others  
* **flexibility**: a lot (yes, really a lot) of open source packages to realize powerful operations  
* **evolution / extensions**: (much more than Excel!) can be used on the cloud with the same code  
* **operability**: works with (almost) the same code on Linux, Mac and Windows
